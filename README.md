# MajiView
MajiView is a simple gui client for searching images by metadata stored in json format. 
It will include features handy to folks who love sharing screenshots as much as I do, most notably:
- Support for wildcard and regular expressions
- Individual results can be copied to clipboard
- Searches can be filtered by access, change, modify, creation times, directories, etc.
- Metadata from json files can be batch imported into images (graphical frontend to an ExifTool feature)
